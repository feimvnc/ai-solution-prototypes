# Project Title    
    
AI solution prototypes.     
    
## Description    
    
A colleciton of AI solution prototypes from simple CLI to end to end solutions.    
    
## Getting Started    
    
### Dependencies    
    
* RAM     
* MacOS, windows should work, there can be library version differences.    
* python 3.10.11, this version is comptabile to most ML libraries, mentioned by Matthew Berman in his videos at https://www.youtube.com/@matthew_berman as of July 2023.    
    
    
### Installing    
    
* git clone https://github.com/feimvnc/ai-solution-prototypes.git    
* python start.py    
    
### Executing program    
    
* How to run the program    
* A start.py is available in each folder, borrowing this file name from py docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html    
```    
python start.py    
```    
    
or on MacOS terminal, run similar commands    
```    
./run.sh    
```    
    
## Help    
    
You may see more issues when more frameworks, libraries, tools are used.    
Troubleshooting takes extra amount of time, especially if there are more complex issues.    
Backup code before integrating with new libraries helps.     
```    
command to run if program contains helper info    
```
